## About

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, focusing on algorithmic patterns and interview preparation.

**Key Features:**
- Dual-language implementations (every problem in both C and Python)
- Pattern-based problem-solving approach
- Clean, optimized code

---

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a single problem with solutions in both languages:
```
leetcode-solutions/
├── 0001_Two_Sum/
│   ├── solution.c
│   └── solution.py
├── 0002_Add_Two_Numbers/
│   ├── solution.c
│   └── solution.py
├── 0003_Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating_Characters/
│   ├── solution.c
│   └── solution.py
└── ...
```

**Naming convention:** `<problem_number>_<problem_name>/`

All problems include both `solution.c` and `solution.py`
